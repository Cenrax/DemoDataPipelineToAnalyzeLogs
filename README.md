# Demo: Data Pipeline To AnalyzeLogs
This is a demo project to create a pipeline based on the logs collected from a NGINX log file

## Problem Statement and Goal
The goal of our pipeline will be to take log lines, from the example_log.txt file, and create a summary CSV file of unique HTTP request types and their associated counts. Each line from the example_log.txt file is from an NGINX log file. This log file contains each client request sent to a running web server in a client-server model.
